About

Instatistics is a data visualization tool for the popular social media platform, Instagram. Users login via the Instagram API and we take care of the rest! Any image that a user has posted will be parsed for information and displayed in meaningful ways that show the user how they portray themselves on Instagram. But it doesn't stop there. After statistics are generated, the user can simply share the URL with friends so they can see the statistics as well! Instatistics can also extend to professional photographers and businesses who hope to discover trends that can help increase their outreach.
